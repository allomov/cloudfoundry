A Juju charm to generate CF charms from metadata and
manage them at runtime.

Deployment
----------

    juju deploy cloudfoundry
    juju set cloudfoundry admin_secret=`cat ${JUJU_HOME:-~/.juju}/environments/$(juju switch).jenv|grep admin-secret|awk '{print $2;}'`

This will boot up the bundle orchestrator which will watch and manage a CF
deployment using juju.

Once the deployment is running you will see juju deploy all of the needed
services. When this is going you will be able to 

    ENDPOINT=`juju status haproxy/0 |grep public-address|cut -f 2 -d : `
    IP=`dig +short $ENDPOINT`
    # get the _IP_ of the public address
    cf api http://api.${IP}.xip.io 
    cf login -u admin -p admin
    cf create-space my-space
    cf target -o my-org -s my-space

You can now push apps.



Development
-----------

For any given release we support (see cloudfoundry.releases) you should be able
to generate an example of the bundle we'll deploy and manage by doing:

    . .tox/py27/bin/activate
    python charmgen.generator <release>

This will create a cloudfoundry-r<release> directory with the bundle.yaml and a
trusty repo will all the created charms.

There are currently two experimental tools included with the charm. These
are designed to process a cf-release checkout and examine the differences
in various tagged versions of cf-release.

    . .tox/py27/bin/activate
    # skip if you have a cf-release checkout
    git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release.git ../cf-release
    python setup.py develop
    get_revisions -d ../cf-release 153..173
    diff_revisions 153..173 | less

You can also use the following command on the cc unit to monitor the routes
registered with NATS, which can be very helpful for debugging:

    cd /var/vcap/packages/cloud_controller_ng/cloud_controller_ng/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1
    /var/vcap/packages/ruby/bin/bundle exec bin/nats-sub -s `grep -o 'nats://.*' /var/vcap/jobs/cloud_controller_ng/config/cloud_controller_ng.yml` ">"


* TODO

  Attempt to generate service definitions and relation classes from
  cf-release.
